Hey, if you're wondering why on earth I would create another guide when there's an official one, let me explain. The reason is that the official guide isn't very in-depth when it comes to roleplay; it's more of a basic guide for beginners. This guidebook, on the other hand, will provide you with comprehensive information about the server, including details like how to obtain berry seeds, and more.
